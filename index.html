      Ciao and welcome to my portfolio project webpage! My name is Erica
      Fricker, and I’m a 17 year old student in Grade 11 at A.Y. Jackson
      Secondary School in Canada’s capital city, Ottawa. I am currently enrolled
      in Mr. Osudar’s ICS4U course, working hard to learn about coding and
      programming in general. Throughout the year, I have been working on
      learning many different languages, experimenting with many different
      projects, and overall just trying new things to expand my knowledge with
      computer science! This webpage was created as part of my end year
      portfolio project, so feel free to take a look around and explore my top
      modules. Thanks for visiting! If you'd like to contact me about my work, my webpage or anything else, email me at efric2@ocdsb.ca.
