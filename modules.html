      Learning HTML and CSS was one of the first modules I had completed at the
      beginning of this course, all through Khan Academy. I started this course
      with no previous knowledge of HTML or CSS, and it would start as the basis
      of my knowledge of web development as well. Following the many lessons,
      challenges and projects that Khan Academy had to provide to me, I engaged
      in the learning presented to me by going through each and every one of
      them. By the end of the course, I developed an understanding of how html
      and css worked together to create visible, easy-to follow web pages and
      content. An example of some of the work I did can be found here in my
      project titled “Event Invite” as well.
