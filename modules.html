      <h2>Into To HTML and CSS</h2>

        Learning HTML and CSS was one of the first modules I had completed at
        the beginning of this course, all through Khan Academy. I started this
        course with no previous knowledge of HTML or CSS, and it would start as
        the basis of my knowledge of web development as well. Following the many
        lessons, challenges and projects that Khan Academy had to provide to me,
        I engaged in the learning presented to me by going through each and
        every one of them. By the end of the course, I developed an
        understanding of how html and css worked together to create visible,
        easy-to follow web pages and content. An example of some of the work I
        did can be found here in my project titled “Event Invite” as well.

        To complete this module, I followed the recommended path on Khan
        Academy: also known as the Introduction to JavaScript. Prior to this
        course, I had learned about JavaScript and its basics, so I was familiar
        with the concepts present in this module. This however was my first
        experience with object oriented programming, because my previous teacher
        from the ICS3U had only focused on the functions part of JavaScript. It
        was a little bit hard at first to get used to object oriented
        programming, but over time I found that I enjoyed working with physical
        objects on the screen, and it often made it easier to work with my code
        because I could tell if it wasn’t functioning properly almost
        immediately after the input. Using the skills I learned in this module,
        I will be able to go forward with object oriented programming and
        JavaScript, both while continuing my learning into the future. Above is
        one of the challenges I completed towards the end of the course.

      <h2>AP Programming - Khan Academy</h2>

        For this specific module, I worked on my logical skills relating to the
        AP Programming strand on Khan Academy. Developing my overall
        understanding of code and even learning about something entirely new-
        pseudocode- guided me through this module. I completed every lesson and
        quiz in this course, and passed the unit test at the end of the course
        as well. Finishing the course up to 79% understanding/completion, I
        developed my previous knowledge in computer science skills as well as
        diving into new functions and ideas as well.

        During the course of about a three week period, three classmates and I
        worked together on our hackathon, which at the time, was a pretty
        daunting task. Our proposal started with the idea to create a mental
        health resource, since our group noticed that there weren't a lot of
        resources available to students online about mental health, as a lot of
        the main ones that students would try to access at school were blocked
        by the OCDSB. To connect it to computer science though, we had to find a
        way to involve mental health in some sort of code or programming. So, we
        created a website using HTML, Javascript and CSS using Glitch as our web
        developer. This hackathon was the first time I created a website, so it
        helped me to get more comfortable with using HTML and CSS, while also
        learning what I consider a pretty basic skill in web development.
        Working through different files as a group was another thing I had to
        work on during this project, because I had never really worked on a
        larger project in a group before with computer science. Overall, this
        project helped me grow my skills regarding web development, especially
        in a fun group setting, and I even got to learn about more mental health
        resources that I will be able to use or provide to others in the future
        if they need them.
