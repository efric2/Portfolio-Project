        Learning HTML and CSS was one of the first modules I had completed at
        the beginning of this course, all through Khan Academy. I started this
        course with no previous knowledge of HTML or CSS, and it would start as
        the basis of my knowledge of web development as well. Following the many
        lessons, challenges and projects that Khan Academy had to provide to me,
        I engaged in the learning presented to me by going through each and
        every one of them. By the end of the course, I developed an
        understanding of how html and css worked together to create visible,
        easy-to follow web pages and content. An example of some of the work I
        did can be found here in my project titled “Event Invite” as well.

      <h2>Intro To JavaScript</h2>

        To complete this module, I followed the recommended path on Khan
        Academy: also known as the Introduction to JavaScript. Prior to this
        course, I had learned about JavaScript and its basics, so I was familiar
        with the concepts present in this module. This however was my first
        experience with object oriented programming, because my previous teacher
        from the ICS3U had only focused on the functions part of JavaScript. It
        was a little bit hard at first to get used to object oriented
        programming, but over time I found that I enjoyed working with physical
        objects on the screen, and it often made it easier to work with my code
        because I could tell if it wasn’t functioning properly almost
        immediately after the input. Using the skills I learned in this module,
        I will be able to go forward with object oriented programming and
        JavaScript, both while continuing my learning into the future. Above is
        one of the challenges I completed towards the end of the course.
